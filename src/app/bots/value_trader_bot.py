# -----------------------------
# Bot 4: ValueTrader
# - Bids based on expected gem value (from partial info),
#   plus trinket bonus, plus rational handling of loans/investments.
# - Loans are treated as "net cost = bid" now and "repay principal later":
#   so only take loans if bid is low and you need liquidity (or late game).
# - Investments are treated as "profit = payout - 0" + return of locked:
#   so net gain at end is payout; bid should be <= discounted payout.
